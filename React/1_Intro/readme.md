# React

* **Components**
    - The building blocks of React
    - Pieces of UI & view logic
    - Classes that know how to render themselves into HTML
    
    - **Class Components:**
        - The *traditiona* React component
        - Write logic in a JS Class
        - Must include a render method

    - **Function Components:**
        - Historically used for simpler *dumb* components
        - Write logic in a JS Function
        - No render method needed, just return content
